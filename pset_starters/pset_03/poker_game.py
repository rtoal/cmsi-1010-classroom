# This is the file poker_game.py
#
# In this file, you will write a program that repeatedly prompts the user
# for a number of players in a poker game, then, if the input is valid,
# deals each player a 5-card hand then prints each hand and its poker
# classification.
#
# As in previous assignments, allow an input of "bye" or "exit" (after
# stripping and lowercasing the user's input) to quit the program.
#
# You will be graded on how carefully you handle invalid input. Your
# program should not crash or raise an exception if the user enters
# something that is not a valid number of players, or if the user
# enters a number of players that is not between 2 and 10. Instead,
# your program should print an error message and prompt the user again
# for a valid number of players.
#
# Remove ALL of the existing comments in this file prior to submission.
# You can, and should, add your own comments, but please remove all the
# comments that are here now.
#
# Remember that for this assignment, you will also be creating a module
# for cards in cards.py. You will have to figure out the import
# statement to use in this file to import the functions and classes
# you need from that module.
